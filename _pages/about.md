I recently graduated with my PhD from [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu), where I was advised by [Julian Jara-Ettinger](https://psychology.yale.edu/people/julian-jara-ettinger) in the [Computational Social Cognition Lab](https://compdevlab.yale.edu/).

My research falls under the broad umbrella of computational cognitive science: merging insights and tools from cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and computer science to (1) understand and formalize how people make rich, flexible inferences as they navigate the world and (2) leverage this understanding to develop better artificial intelligence systems.
