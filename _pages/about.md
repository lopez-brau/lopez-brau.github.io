I recently graduated with my PhD from [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), where I was advised by [Julian Jara-Ettinger](https://psychology.yale.edu/people/julian-jara-ettinger/) in the [Computational Social Cognition Lab](https://compdevlab.yale.edu/). I also worked with [Brian Scholl](https://perception.yale.edu/Brian/) in the [Perception and Cognition Lab](https://perception.yale.edu/).

My research during graduate school focused on understanding **how people extract social information from objects**, such as how we recognize that a coat on a chair likely means it is occupied or that a ball in the road likely means children are playing nearby, and **formalizing these inferences as computer programs**. In my work, I utilized a blend of behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and psychophysics.

Before Yale, I was a [McNair Scholar](https://mcnairscholars.com/about/) at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/), where I studied electrical engineering with minors in computer science and mathematics.
